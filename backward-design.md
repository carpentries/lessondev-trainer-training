## Discussion Questions

* What are the three stages of the backward design process?
  How are they addressed in the lesson development process?
* Why is it helpful to start the lesson development process with the target audience in mind?
* In The Carpentries, we tend to present learning _objectives_ as opposed to _outcomes_. 
  What distinction, if any, do you see between these two terms?
  Which do you think is more appropriate?
  In your opinion, should The Carpentries switch over and start listing "Outcomes" instead of "Objectives" on episodes pages?
* How is designing assessments helpful in the lesson design process?
* How to decide what to teach first? How to decide what not to teach?
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of backward design?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

* Backward design describes a process for curriculum development that begins with the definition of skills learners will obtain from following the curriculum.
* The main steps of backward design are: 
  * defining learning outcomes.
  * designing learning experiences to achieve those outcomes.
  * developing content to support these experiences.
  * assessing learners' progress towards the desired outcomes.
  * evaluating the curriculum design based on this assessment.
* Backward design helps keep curriculum development focussed on the intended learner, and it can make it easier to trim down lesson content to focus only on what is required to achieve specific outcomes.
* Creating a new lesson/curriculum with backward design can take more time than an alternative, "content-first" approach.
