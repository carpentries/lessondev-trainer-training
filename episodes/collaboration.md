::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Good collaboration allow you to create better lessons, faster, and to have more fun while you are doing it.
- Structured decision-making, especially among close colleagues and/or friends, can feel unnecessarily formal early in a project.
- On the other hand, it is easier to establish decision-making processes early and before any substantial disagreements have occured.
