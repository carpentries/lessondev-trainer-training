## Homework/Reading for Next Week

- **Homework:** Read [CLDT episode: The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/07-infrastructure.html) and follow the steps in the episode, creating and configuring a new lesson repository, while you read through the content. 
  - Note down any problems you encounter along the way, no matter whether they were minor (i.e. slowed you down or confused you temporarily, but did not stop you from progressing) or major (i.e. you had to give up or ask for help).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Good collaboration allow you to create better lessons, faster, and to have more fun while you are doing it.
- Structured decision-making, especially among close colleagues and/or friends, can feel unnecessarily formal early in a project.
- On the other hand, it is easier to establish decision-making processes early and before any substantial disagreements have occured.
