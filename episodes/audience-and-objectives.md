## Discussion Questions
- What should a good learner profile cover?
- What are the different ways learner profiles can be used?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Getting a clear image of the target audience at the beginning of the lesson development process helps with better focus and that the lesson will address the needs of the learners.
- Understanding your audience’s prior knowledge will help you choose the right level of instruction and set realistic goals.
- Communicating the target audience clearly will help you attract the right participants.
- Bloom’s taxonomy serves as a very useful bank of action verbs for use in learning objectives.
- SMART framework is a valuable tool used for defining clear objectives.
