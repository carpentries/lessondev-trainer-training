## About this Training

The goal of this training is to prepare participants to teach [The Carpentries Collaborative Lesson Development Training][cldt-curriculum] (CLDT).

The training will involve weekly discussion calls attended by trainees and facilitators, as well as reading tasks and occasional, more practical, homework tasks.
The reading and other tasks have been selected to provide trainees with insight into the CLDT curriculum, some of the literature on which it is based, and the experience participants will have when in the lesson development training.

### Weekly training structure

Each episode of this lesson site corresponds to a week of Trainer Training, and contains _Reading List_, _Discussion Questions_ and _Homework/Reading for Next Week_ blocks.

- _Reading List_: these are the resources trainees should read _before joining_ the weekly discussion call.
  When reading episodes from the CLDT curriculum, please make sure that you are viewing the page in _Instructor View_ so that inline Instructor Notes are displayed on the page.
- _Discussion Questions_: these questions will form the basis for the agenda of the weekly discussion call, though discussions are likely to elaborate on and stray away from these starting questions.
- _Homework/Reading for Next Week_: this block provides trainees with an overview of the tasks they are expected to complete before the next weekly discussion call.

The final episode provides a list of tasks trainees need to complete before they can be certified as a Lesson Developer Trainer.

## Collaborative Lesson Development Training is Changing!

Informed by experience and feedback gathered over the first few years of teaching and administering the training program, a redesigned version of CLDT will be launched in January 2026.
We will talk more about what has changed and why as we progress through this training.
For now, it is essential for trainees to be aware that many of the links for reading in this Trainer Training will point to [a preview of the updated version of the CLDT curriculum][cldt26-preview].
This redesigned content will be merged into [the official version of the curriculum][cldt-curriculum] at the end of 2025.
