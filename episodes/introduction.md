## Curriculum is a work in progress

Any lesson or curriculum has room for improvement,
especially when it is relatively new and not extensively tested.
The CLDT curriculum is still in the early stages of the development process:
it has only been taught twice, both times by its primary authors.
If you think that something is wrong, missing, or could be improved somehow,
please report it by opening an issue on [the source repository][cldt-repo] 
or - even better - open a pull request to suggest the improvement.

The curriculum belongs to the community - let's develop it together!
