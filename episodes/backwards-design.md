## Discussion Questions

- In The Carpentries, we tend to present learning _objectives_ as opposed to _outcomes_. 
  What distinction, if any, do you see between these two terms?
  Which do you think is more appropriate?
  In your opinion, should The Carpentries switch over 
  e.g. to start listing "Outcomes" instead of "Objectives" on episodes pages?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Backwards design describes a process for curriculum development that 
  begins with the definition of skills learners will obtain from following the curriculum.
- The main steps of backwards design are: 
  - defining learning outcomes, 
  - designing learning experiences to achieve those outcomes,
  - developing content to support these experiences,
  - assessing learners' progress towards the desired outcomes,
  - and evaluating the curriculum design based on this assessment.
- Backwards design helps keep curriculum development focussed on the intended learner, 
  and it can make it easier to trim down lesson content to focus only on 
  what is required to achieve speicfic outcomes.
- Creating a new lesson/curriculum with backwards design can take more time 
  than an alternative, "content-first" approach.
