:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

## Discussion Questions

* What are different formative assessment strategies that can help diagnose issues with the lesson?
  Discuss the effectiveness of those strategies. 
  Give some examples of what actionable feedback might look like.
* How do you think the optimal ratio of time spent on teaching and exercises changes as learner expertise increases?
  E.g. do you think a novice lesson will include more content to be taught and less time devoted to challenges/discussions, compared to an intermediate lesson on a similar topic?
* What are some advantages and disadvantages of requiring trainees to teach (some of) their new lessons to complete their Lesson Developer certification?
* How complete do you like a lesson to be before you teach it for the first time?
* Some trainees are reluctant to trial incomplete or unstructured material, feeling a lack of confidence at being able to improvise in response to questions/unexpected results, or fill in steps in the teaching examples on the fly.
  What guidance would you give to a trainee, to help them find a balance between preparing lesson content and taking an opportunity to gather feedback by teaching it?
* What strategies could we encourage trainees to use, to convert the feedback they gather when teaching a lesson into actionable recommendations for improving it?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

* The effectiveness of a lesson can only be assessed by teaching it.
* Direct and indirect feedback collected while teaching should be used to improve the lesson for next time.
* Trainees are required to try teaching a section of their new lesson and report back on the experience to complete their Lesson Developer certification.
