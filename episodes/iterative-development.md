:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

## Discussion Questions

- What are different formative assessment strategies that can help diagnose issues with the lesson?
  Discuss the effectiveness of those strategies. 
  Give some examples of what actionable feedback might look like.
- How do you think the optimal ratio of time spent on teaching and exercises changes
  as learner expertise increases?
  E.g. do you think a novice lesson will include more content to be taught 
  and less time devoted to challenges/discussions, 
  compared to an intermediate lesson on a similar topic?
- What are some advantages and disadvantages of 
  requiring trainees to teach (some of) their new lessons as part of their training?
- How complete do you like a lesson to be before you teach it for the first time?
- Some trainees are reluctant to trial incomplete or unstructured material, 
  feeling a lack of confidence at being able to improvise in response to questions/unexpected results,
  or fill in steps in the teaching examples on the fly.
  What guidance would you give to a trainee, to help them find a balance between preparing lesson content
  and taking an opportunity to gather feedback by teaching it?
- What strategies could we encourage trainees to use,
  to convert the feedback they gather when teaching a lesson into 
  actionable recommendations for improving it?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- The effectiveness of a lesson can only be assessed by teaching it.
- Direct and indirect feedback collected while teaching should be used to
  improve the lesson for next time.
- Trainees are required to try teaching a section of their new lesson in a "trial run"
  during the break in Collaborative Lesson Development Training.
