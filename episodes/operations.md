- Collaborative Lesson Development Training is designed to be taught in two parts, 
  with an extended break in between.
- The Carpentries Incubator is a space for community development of lessons. Lessons developed in the Incubator can be submitted for open peer review and acceptance to The Carpentries Lab, and/or adoption as a new official lesson one of The Carpentries lesson programs.
- To complete certification, trainees must participate in both parts of the training and perform a trial run of at least some of their lesson during the break.
