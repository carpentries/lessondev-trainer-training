::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Lesson developers will initialise a new lesson from a template repository,
  which they will then need to configure and start adding episodes to.
- Developers will often need some support with the first stages of lesson setup,
  especially if they are not yet familiar with GitHub and/or Markdown.
