:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

## Introductions

The first discussion session will begin with a full round of Introductions,
where trainees and facilitators will be given the opportunity to share some details about themselves
and their past experience with curriculum development and The Carpentries.

## About this Training

The goal of this training is to prepare participants to teach
[The Carpentries Collaborative Lesson Development Training][cldt] (CLDT).

The training will involve weekly discussion calls 
attended by trainees and facilitators,
as well as reading tasks and occasional, more practical, homework tasks.
The reading and other tasks have been selected to 
provide trainees with insight into the CLDT curriculum,
some of the literature on which it is based,
and the experience participants will have when in the lesson development training.

### Weekly training structure

Each episode of this lesson site corresponds to a week of Trainer Training,
and contains _Reading List_, _Discussion Questions_ 
and _Homework/Reading for Next Week_ blocks.

- _Reading List_: these are the resources trainees should read _before joining_ the weekly discussion call.
- _Discussion Questions_: these questions will form the basis for the agenda of the weekly discussion call,
  though discussions are likely to elaborate on and stray away from these starting questions.
- _Homework/Reading for Next Week_: this block provides trainees with an overview of the tasks they are expected to complete before the next weekly discussion call.

The final episode provides a list of tasks trainees need to complete 
before they can be certified as a Lesson Developer Trainer.

## Curriculum is a work in progress

Any lesson or curriculum has room for improvement,
especially when it is relatively new and not extensively tested.

If you think that something is wrong, missing, or could be improved
in this training curriculum or the CLDT curriculum,
please report it by opening an issue on the source repository
([source for this training](https://github.com/carpentries/lessondev-trainer-training/); [source for CLDT][cldt-repo])
or - even better - open a pull request to suggest the improvement.

The curriculum belongs to the community - let's develop it together!
