## Discussion Questions

- Some trainees are reluctant to trial incomplete or unstructured material, 
  feeling a lack of confidence at being able to improvise in response to questions/unexpected results,
  or fill in steps in the teaching examples on the fly.
  What guidance would you give to a trainee, to help them find a balance between preparing lesson content
  and taking an opportunity to gather feedback by teaching it?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- The effectiveness of a lesson can only be assessed by teaching it.
- Direct and indirect feedback collected while teaching should be used to
  improve the lesson for next time.
- Trainees are required to try teaching a section of their new lesson in a "trial run"
  during the break in Collaborative Lesson Development Training.
